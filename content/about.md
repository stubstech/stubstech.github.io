## About this site
This is my personal blog where I try to keep it technology and security oriented.


## Who is s0vi?

I am working as a security consultant at Netsecurity in Norway. My background is from the military and law enforcement, where I've both studied and worked with digital evidence as a special investigator. 

My passion for computers started when I was gaming in high school, but I quickly delved into php and looking at tools that could be used to reverse engineer software. I did not understand alot, but tools such as [SoftICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftICE) and all the cracktros made me feel like a leet hacker. Nothing was cooler than knowing [Razor1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_1911) was a Norwegian band of crackers.

I also liked to make maps in different games, such as Across (Action SuperCross and later Elasto Mania), Warcraft III and some in Half-Life. Though, 3D maps was really hard.

Although I was basically a script kiddie, my PHP development and MySQL knowledge increased, and when I started my bachelors, I felt Java, C and C++ wasn't that hard to use and understand. At least the basics.

Things that interests me are digital forensics, circumventing authentication and detecting malicious software in memory and other artefacts.
